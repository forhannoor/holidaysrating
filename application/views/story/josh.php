<p>One of the most interesting and special places I have seen till now. It contains spectacular geographically diverse features in its relatively small area. Depends what you are interested in doing during your holiday, the country has got a lot to offer; history, nature, sport activities, night life, tracking, warm weather, and in my opinion some of the best dishes in the world. I believe anyone could find a few points of interest and have an amazing holiday.

Israel is located on the south-eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. The country borders with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. It is also the only way to cross by land through the Asian and African contents.<br /> 
Summer; around the months June, July, August can get very hot and humid.
Winter; around the months November, December, January are usually rainy but still not cold.
The reason I like this place so much is because it has got a mixture of so many different cultures from around the world all living in the same area, you will feel like you are traveling and experiencing many different countries at once; different types of life style, religion, food, music, traditional clothing, holidays, languages and more.

It takes about 10 hours to drive from north to south, only 2-3 hours at the longest parts from east to west. So renting a car would be a great way to see the country as everything is so close, no need for internal flights. Public transport is not to bad, with trains running from the north to about 3 hours from the most southern point, and buses that can get you just about everywhere.
The northern part of the country is very green with lots of mountains. One mountain named, “Mount Chermon”, good for skiing and snowboarding in the winter season if it gets enough snow that year.
After the winter, the snow on the mountains heat up and start running down the Jordan River. That is a good time of year to go out rafting or kayaking in the fresh water on a nice hot day.
All that water eventually reaches a big lake named “the Kineret”, that is a good place for a day or two of camping. <br />

Lowest place on earth, -414 Meters, named the “Dead Sea”. The water in this place is very healthy for the skin, full of minerals combined with the UV sunlight that reaches this area, as well as natural mud baths, became well known around the world as a method that can heal skin. Something I have seen only in this special part of the world as the water has got such a high concentration of salt it will make you float.

South of the country is less populated and you will notice the scenery around you changing from green mountains to a desert, big sand dunes with different colors of brown and red, as you will be getting closer to the African continent, connecting to Egypt in the south west. It can get very hot in the day time so remember to drink lots of water. Just as the sun goes down, you will feel a big drop in the temperature, so bring warm clothing with to.

Jerusalem; the capital of Israel, one of the oldest cities in the world. Considered holy to the three major religions; Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Old City became a World Heritage site, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The most religious place for the Jewish religion is the Western wall, in Hebrew “Hakotel Hama’ravi”, every synagogue in world is facing this direction.</p>
