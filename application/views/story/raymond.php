<p>Dominica is a unspoiled island, full with nature and just fabulous. When you are in the Caribbean, you definitely need to visit this great destination! So three years ago, my wife and I decided to spend a few days in Dominica.
We bought a ticket with Liat Airways and we flew from Saint martin to the Commonwealth of Dominica. Or just Dominica. It was a hell of a flight. Small airplanes, clouds and wind are a perfect combination for heavy turbulance but luckely it is just 40 minutes away....</p>

<p style="text-align:left;margin-top:7px">Once on the ground, the first thing you see is beautiful nature all around. Everywhere you look; green, green and green. The mountains sticking into the clouds.
Although the Commonwealth of Dominica is independant, it still has got UK written on her. One of the examples would be the fact they drive on the left side. Here they drive on he left-side. For some this can be very scary. Not that I find it difficult to drive but more because I always look to the wrong side of the road when I want to cross the road walking! This time bus almost hit me..</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:15px">Around the island</h4>
<p style="text-align:left">This amazing island has got plenty of things to do. Walk one of the many tracks in the rainforest, located in the center of the island, find the many waterfalls or lakes, including the second world largest boiling lake or go shopping in Rosseau.<br /><br />
My wife and I hired a car at the airport and from there we drove around the island. Rosseau is the largest and capital city with a small port for cruiseships, where Portsmouth has got the bigger airport. It is just amazing to ride over the scenic highway, beautiful coastline filled with palms and white sandy beaches.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px"> The best time to visit Dominica is from October to December, when the temperatures are perfect, hotel rates are lower and the humidity is less stifling.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:left;margin-top:15px">Rain season</h4>
<p style="text-align:left">Dominica's rain season occurs between June and November, and the island is susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms during this time of year. Ofcourse we had a lot of clouds and rain but this did not spoil our holiday.</p>
<p>If this is my favorite travel destination? I do not know but it is definitly worth every penny! I enjoyed my stay on Dominica.</p>
